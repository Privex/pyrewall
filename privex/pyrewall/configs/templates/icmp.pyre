# For ICMPv4 there's not many dangerous packet types unlike IPv6's ICMP packets related to 
# neighbour discovery, auto-configuration etc.
# So we just need a simple 'allow'
rem4 Allow all incoming ICMPv4 traffic such as ping and traceroute packets
allow icmp4

# As for IPv6, there's a wide range of ICMPv6 types that we need allow either globally
# (from anywhere), and others which should only ever be accepted from LAN IP's.
