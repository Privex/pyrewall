#
# Systemd Service file for `privex/pyrewall`
#
# To use this file, copy it into /etc/systemd/system/pyrewall.service
#
# If the main Pyrewall binary 'pyre' isn't installed at /usr/local/bin/pyre (type 'which pyre' and 'whereis pyre'),
# then you'll want to adjust ExecStart to point to the correct binary location
#
# Once adjusted for your specific installation, run the following:
#
#    systemctl enable pyrewall.service
#    systemctl start pyrewall.service
#
# Pyrewall will now have ran it's Pyre rule loader in the background as a systemd service,
# and will automatically start on reboot, loading rules from the master file at /etc/pyrewall/rules.pyre
# or from an alternative file/folder within it's search paths.
